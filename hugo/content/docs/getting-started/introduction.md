Data Connect is a standard for discovery and search of biomedical data, developed by the [Discovery Work Stream](https://github.com/ga4gh-discovery/ga4gh-discovery.github.io) of the [Global Alliance for Genomics & Health](http://ga4gh.org).

The standard provides a mechanism for:

- Describing data and its data model.
  - Data Connect's _Table API_ component provides a way to organize data into "Tables" and describe their data model, leveraging the JSON Schema standard.
- Searching the data with the given data model.
  - Data Connect's _Search API_ component provides a way to query "Tables" of data, leveraging the SQL standard.

It is **not** in the scope of the standard to:

- Define said data models.
  - Data Connect relies on other efforts in GA4GH (e.g. [GA4GH SchemaBlocks](https://schemablocks.org/)), as well as outside implementers.

### Background

GA4GH has previously developed two standards for discovery. `Beacon` is a standard for discovery of genomic variants, while `Matchmaker` is a standard for discovery of subjects with certain genomic and phenotypic features. Implementations of these standards have been linked into federated networks (e.g. [Beacon Network](https://beacon-network.org/) and [Matchmaker Exchange](http://matchmakerexchange.org)).

Both standards (and the corresponding networks) have been successful in their own right, but had a lot in common. It was acknowledged that it would be broadly useful to develop standards that abstract common infrastructure for building searchable, federated networks for a variety of applications in genomics and health.

Data Connect, formerly known as _GA4GH Search_, is this general-purpose middleware for building federated, search-based applications. The name of the API reflects its purpose of:

- Giving data providers a mechanism to enable others to connect to their data via the described data models.
- Allowing data consumers to make connections within the data through a flexible query language.

### Benefits

- **Interoperable**. Simple, interoperable, uniform mechanism to publish, discover, and search biomedical data.
- **Flexible**. Works with any data that can be serialized as an array of JSON objects. Recommends the use of [GA4GH SchemaBlocks](https://schemablocks.org/) data models, but allows custodians to specify their own data models to make their data available without extensive ETL transformations.
- **Supports federation**. Serves as a general-purpose framework for building federatable search-based applications across multiple implementations. Federations reference common schemas and properties.
- **Minimal by design**. The API is purposely kept minimal so that the barriers to publishing existing data are as small as possible.
- **Backend agnostic**. It is possible to implement the API across a large variety of backend datastores.
- **General purpose**. Admits use cases that have not yet been thought of.

### Use cases

Data Connect is an intentionally general-purpose middleware meant to enable the development of a diverse ecosystem of applications.

The community has built versions of the following applications on top of Data Connect:

- Data Explorers
- Beacons
- Patient matchmaking
- Jupyter notebooks
- R data frames
- Command line query tools
- Data and metadata indexers
- Data federations
- Concept cross-references

We're looking forward to seeing things we havenâ€™t yet imagined!

The community has also connected data through the following data sources:

- FHIR
- Relational databases
- CSV/TSV files with data dictionaries
- VCF+TBI files
- Phenopackets
- Google BigQuery
- Google Sheets
- and more!

Examples of queries on the data that can be answered via Data Connect include:

- Find subjects with HP:0001519 and candidate gene FBN1 (use case of [Matchmaker Exchange](https://www.matchmakerexchange.org/))
- Find male subjects with HP:0009726 consented for General Research Use (use case of [European Genome-phenome Archive](https://ega-archive.org/))
- Find adult males diagnosed with autism having a harmful mutation in SHANK1 (use case of [Autism Sharing Initiative](http://autismsharinginitiative.org))
- Find dataset from subject on European data center hosted on Amazon (use case of [Cloud Work Stream](https://github.com/ga4gh/wiki/wiki))

Full summary of use cases can be found in [USECASES.md](USECASES.md).
