          description: >
            The "source" field should only be present when the error originated in an attached data source backing the Search
            API. The value of source can be any of the following:

            1. A fully qualified table `name`
            2. Any prefix of a table `name` that ends before a `.` character in the name. For example
            if there is a table called `foo.bar.baz`, valid prefixes would be `foo` and `foo.bar`. Partial prefixes
            which do not end just before a `.`, are not valid. For example: `foo.b` and `fo` are not allowed.

            If the error originated inside the Search API implementation and is not associated with any particular table
            or group of tables, then the source must be absent. An example of this would be an error occurring from a bug
            in the implementation. Additionally, if the error is due to a bad request from the client, the source must
            also be absent.

            attributes needed to inform the client of the error.

        Error codes are strings which the Search API can use to communicate the "Type" of error which a request has
        encountered. There are two error codes with all search API's and clients are required to understand

        1. `ERROR_RESPONSE`: This is a general error code, indicating that some error has occurred while attempting to fulfill
        the clients request. If it is unclear which type of error code a server should return, it may use `ERROR_RESPONSE` as a "catch-all"

        2. `NO_RESPONSE`: Search servers should respond with this error code if they fail to receive a response from their configured
        data source within a set timeout period.

        Search API servers may extend the list of error codes, allowing them to define codes which match the particular error
        cases which they may encounter. Search API servers should ideally provide documentation describing the list of all error codes
        it will return and when they will be returned. If a client encounters a custom error code it does not understand,
        it must handle it as an `ERROR_RESPONSE` code.
